## Background
### Reinforcement learning basics

#### _Agent_

#### _Environment_

#### _Action_

#### _Reward_


## Perception

The agent is able to _sniff_ food in 4 main directions - left,up,right,down.
Sniffing is based on position of the fruit obtained from the game environment and
projected as boolean list of directions.




## The Agent

## Training

### Neural net model

Used model is fully connected network built of two linear layers.<br>
